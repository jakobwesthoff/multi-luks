# First hash the password 16 times using md5 and no salt
hash md5 16
# Next hash the password 32 using sha1 and some salt as salt.
hash sha1 32 'some salt'
# decrypt the disc /dev/loop0. Name the decrypted mapper crypto-test1
disc /dev/loop0 crypto-test1

# currently the hash command supports the following hash sums:
# md5, md4, md2, sha1, sha, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512, mdc2 and ripemd160

# hash a little bit more for the second disc
hash sha1 32 'some other salt'
hash md5 16
# decrypt the second disc
disc /dev/loop1 crypto-test2
